# PyInvest Package #

This package contains methods that I use when undertaking investment valuations. They are a pretty standard approach.

People's approach to investment, and their money is very personal. 

Therefore I'm offering no assurances: feel free to use my work, but I accept no liability for the consequences. Make your own decisions.
